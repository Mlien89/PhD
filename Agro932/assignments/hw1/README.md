Simulate an NGS dataset for two populations with a small reference genome (< 1 Mb) of your
choice, each population with 10 diploid individuals, to address a hypothesis about population
differentiation.




1. Establish a version-controlled directory system to host the project (paste the link here).
Show your work in the GitHub repository in a user-friendly and reproducible manner.



2. Describe your simulation strategy and the hypothesis to test (positive, negative, or
neutral selection).


3. Calculate thetas for each population and compute Fst between the two populations.
4. Visualize and briefly interpret your results.
